## Webpack Version

To use the webpack version of the project:

1. Copy the contents of this folder (except `README.md`) to the root of the project.

2. Delete the `rspack.config.ts` file.

3. Delete the `rspack` and `_webpack` folders.

4. If you have a previous installation, clean the `node_modules` folder.

5. Then install the packages:

   `npm i`

That's it!
